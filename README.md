# Resume-Parser


Using SpaCy, we've developed a model that extracts key information from resumes, trained on a dataset of over 200 resumes. When presented with a new resume, the model quickly generates a summary. SpaCy, a Python and Cython-based open-source library, offers advanced natural language processing capabilities, with pre-trained pipelines and support for over 60 languages. It boasts high speed and neural network models for various tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, parsing, and tagging.
